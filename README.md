# VOLF - Vulnerability Observation &amp; Logging Framework
A Django application for automating the discovery, logging, and assessment of vulnerabilities from online sources.

It provides a GUI where vulnerabilities discovered using the CVE-Scanner script (https://github.com/opeas/CVE-Scanner) are logged and enables quick retrieval of key information about one or multiple vulnerabilities from the MITRE CVE database (https://cve.mitre.org/).
